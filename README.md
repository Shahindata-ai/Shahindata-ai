# 👋 Hi there, I'm Shahin – An Aspiring Data Scientist with a Curious Mind

_Turning curiosity into real-world data solutions — one project at a time._

Welcome to my GitHub!\
I’m diving deep into **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning** — where code meets insight and curiosity drives everything.

---

### 🚀 Who am I?

I'm a former engineering student with a deep love for **problem-solving** and **structured thinking**.\
I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Materials & Metallurgical Engineering from the University of Tehran**, but my passion for data and intelligent systems led me to pivot into tech.

In high school, I ranked **1st in Tehran's Provincial Math Olympiad** and cleared the **first round of Iran's National Math Olympiad**, which still fuels my analytical drive today.

I'm currently preparing to enter a Master’s program in **Industrial Engineering (Optimization & Data Analysis)** — to level up both academically and practically in the world of data.

### 🧰 My Current Toolkit

- 🐍 Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- 📊 Microsoft Excel & PowerPoint (for dashboarding & storytelling)
- 🎨 Graphic Tools: Photoshop, Illustrator, CorelDRAW
- 🛠️ Filmora (for editing educational and portfolio videos)

---

### 🌱 My Philosophy

While I’m still early in this journey, I believe in doing **simple things with excellence**.\
Every project I share here is:

- Carefully structured
- Well-documented
- Focused on learning and growth
- Built with a love for solving real-world problems

I’m not just building projects — I’m building **a mindset, a discipline, and a personal brand**.
